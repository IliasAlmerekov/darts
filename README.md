# Dart score app

Dart score app is an app where you can effortlessly keep track of your dart games.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Set up Node.js 20, dependencies and the Playwright browser as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md → Prerequisites](CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root using `.env.example` as a template.

## Architecture

This project uses a **pages-based architecture**. Route-level pages are grouped in `src/pages`, while cross-cutting logic and reusable UI live in `src/shared`.

### Top-level layout

```
src/
├── app/          # Application bootstrap, routing, global styles, ErrorBoundary
├── assets/       # Static assets: fonts, icons
├── pages/        # Route-level pages (screen modules)
└── shared/       # Shared utilities, UI components, types, API client
```

### Page structure

Each page module is colocated in its own folder and typically follows this shape:

```
pages/<PageName>/
├── index.tsx       # Route entry/page composition
├── components/     # Page-local UI blocks
├── lib/            # Pure helpers/business rules (optional)
├── *.module.css    # Page styles (CSS Modules)
└── *.test.ts(x)    # Unit/integration tests near implementation
```

Not every page needs all folders; keep only what is required.

### Pages

| Page                | Responsibility                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `LoginPage`         | Login flow                         |
| `RegisterPage`      | Registration flow                  |
| `StartPage`         | Pre-game lobby, player preparation |
| `GamePage`          | Active game scoring flow           |
| `GameSummaryPage`   | Post-game summary                  |
| `GamesOverviewPage` | List of all games                  |
| `GameDetailPage`    | Single game details and statistics |
| `StatisticsPage`    | Player statistics summary          |
| `SettingsPage`      | Game/application settings          |
| `JoinedGamePage`    | Player view for joined games       |
| `PlayerProfilePage` | Player profile                     |

### Shared

```
shared/
├── api/            # API modules grouped by domain (client, errors, mappers)
├── hooks/          # Reusable hooks
├── lib/            # Pure utilities (parseThrowValue, player-mappers, routes, soundPlayer, etc.)
├── store/          # Global Nanostores
├── types/          # Shared TypeScript types and ambient declarations
└── ui/             # Reusable UI components (Button, Overlay, Pagination, etc.)
```

### Rules

- Shared logic lives in `shared/`, not copied between pages.
- `shared/` must not import from upper layers (`pages` or `app`).
- Keep route-level pages thin: read params, connect hooks/api, render UI.
- Reuse shared UI and utilities before introducing new global modules.
